Nodejs Demos
============

To run nodejs demos, first install scion:

    npm install scion

Each individual demo has a README in its directory with further instructions.

- [Drawing Tool](http://jbeard4.github.com/SCION/demos/drawing-tool/drawing-tool.html)

To run them locally, just clone the scion-demos project into the path of your local http server.
