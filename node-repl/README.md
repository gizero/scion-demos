This demo illustrates how to interact with SCION from the command line in node.js. You can specify a statechart as an argument, and it will run it in the SCION interpreter, then give you a read-eval-print-loop (REPL) in order to send in events. This can be a useful tool for debugging.

Run this demo as follows:

	./repl.sh path/to/scxml
